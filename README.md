# TimurTripp.com 11ty Source Project

[Ð¢his project](https://github.com/TimurTripp/TimurTripp.com-11ty) contains the files and source code for my personal website, TimurTripp.com. It is licensed under the [MIT license](/LICENSE.md).

- Designed from scratch with simplicity in mind
- Uses YAML configuration files

See [TEST](/TEST.md) for a demo of basic CSS elements provided by the theme.
