    description: |
      The goal in this MMO browser game to play as a dinosaur and climb the food chain to dominate the island. Players can interact with and chase each other in real-time, as well as create an account to earn badges and track their highest scores. The game is a resposive web app compatible with both desktop and mobile devices, and makes use of a custom engine written in Java with a PostgreSQL database for storing player account information.
