  iiod.io:
    name: 'iiod.io'
    description: |
      The goal in this MMO browser game to play as a dinosaur and climb the food chain to dominate the island. Players can interact with and chase each other in real-time, as well as create an account to earn badges and track their highest scores. The game is a resposive web app compatible with both desktop and mobile devices, and makes use of a custom engine written in Java with a PostgreSQL database for storing player account information.

    title: 'Software Enginner'
    department: 'Strategic Relations'
    institution: cu-boulder
    description: |
      My team at CU Boulder is tasked with one of the largest Drupal 7 to 10 multisite migrations in the industry. This necessitates a complete redevelopment of the aging tools used by our site managers to utilize the modern object-oriented principles of Drupal 10 and CKEditor 5.
      
      I consistently stepped up to take on difficult projects. My individual contributions include the [CKEditor 5 Icons](https://www.drupal.org/project/ckeditor5_icons) open-source Drupal module, and the [Site Configuration](https://github.com/CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration) module used by CU Boulder internally. I also attended [DrupalCon Pittsburgh 2023](https://events.drupal.org/pittsburgh2023).
