      As of 2023, a surprisng number of Drupal websites still rely on the ancient Drupal 7 &#8211; released in 2011 and reaching EOL at the start of 2025. My team at CU Boulder is responsible for one of the largest Drupal 7 to 10 multisite migrations in the industry. This necessitates a complete redevelopment of the aging tools used by our site managers to utilize the modern APIs and object-oriented principles of Drupal 10 and CKEditor 5.
      
      I consistently stepped up to take on difficult projects and contributed substantially to the modules and plugins used by our site maintainers and editors, including the [CKEditor 5 Plugin Collection](https://github.com/CuBoulder/ucb_ckeditor_plugins) and [Site Configuration](https://github.com/CuBoulder/ucb_site_configuration) modules. I also attended [DrupalCon Pittsburgh 2023](https://events.drupal.org/pittsburgh2023).
